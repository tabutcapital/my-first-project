Key Elements Explained:
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
<html>: The root element of the HTML document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, like its title and character set.
<body>: Contains the content of the document that is displayed in the browser.
<h1>: Main heading, can go from <h1> to <h6> for subheadings.
<p>: Represents a paragraph.
<a>: Anchor element used to create links.
<ul>: Unordered list, which contains <li> list items.

=======
Basic HTML concepts include:

HTML Structure: HTML documents have a standard structure with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

Elements and Tags: HTML is made up of elements defined by tags, like <p> for paragraphs, <h1> to <h6> for headings, and <a> for links.

Attributes: Elements can have attributes that provide additional information. For example, the <a> tag can have an href attribute to specify the link's destination.

Nesting: HTML elements can be nested within each other, meaning you can place one tag inside another to create a hierarchy.

Lists: There are ordered (<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>) to organize items, with each item wrapped in <li> tags.

Images: The <img> tag is used to display images, requiring the src attribute to point to the image file.

Forms: HTML forms are created using the <form> tag and can include input elements like text fields (<input>), buttons (<button>), and dropdowns (<select>).

Semantic HTML: Using HTML elements that convey meaning, like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>, enhances accessibility and SEO.

Comments: Comments in HTML are added using <!-- comment --> and are not displayed in the browser.

Doctype Declaration: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the top defines the document type and version of HTML being used.

These concepts form the foundation for building web pages using HTML.
